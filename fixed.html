        <p class="pera">
           
            Java is a widely-used, object-oriented programming language that was first developed by James Gosling and
            Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle Corporation) in 1995. It was designed with the
            principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), meaning that Java code can run on any device that has a Java
            Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system.<br><br>

            Here are some key aspects of Java:
            <br>

            ### 1. **Platform Independence:**
            - **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which is platform-independent.
            The JVM executes this bytecode on different platforms, enabling Java to be cross-platform.<br><br>

            ### 2. **Object-Oriented:**
            - Java follows the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), such as inheritance, encapsulation,
            abstraction, and polymorphism. This helps developers organize complex programs by breaking them into
            smaller, reusable parts (objects).<br><br>

            ### 3. **Syntax:**
            - Java's syntax is similar to C and C++, which makes it relatively easy to learn for developers who are
            familiar with those languages. It uses semicolons to end statements and curly braces to define code blocks.
            <br><br>
            ### 4. **Key Features:**
            - **Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection):** Java automatically handles memory allocation and
            deallocation, making it easier for developers to manage memory.
            - **Multithreading:** Java has built-in support for multithreading, allowing multiple tasks to run
            concurrently within a program.
            - **Exception Handling:** Java provides robust mechanisms to handle runtime errors and exceptions, ensuring
            smoother operation of programs.
            - **Security:** Java provides a strong security model, including features like bytecode verification and a
            security manager, which restricts certain operations.
            <br><br>
            ### 5. **Java Development Kit (JDK):**
            - The JDK includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and development tools like the compiler (javac), the
            Java debugger (jdb), and libraries that support Java development.
